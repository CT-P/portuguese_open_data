## Abstract
Recent events across the world have been a warning for democracy stability in established democratic countries. Events such as Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orbán publicity doubting that liberal democracies could remain globally competitive, and the increasing voting share of anti-establishment parties in EU member states.  To understand if we are becoming more polarized, studies focus on measuring Political polarization through surveys and voting data, showing an increase in the last 10 years within EU and USA. This work aims to measure political polarization of discourse data, use text-as-data and computational social science methods, in an effective way independent of manual tasks, language, polarization’s actors and environments. 
I present an empirical framework applied to parliament discourses and Twitter data, with a Discourse Polarization Trend metric which enable to assess how is evolving the political polarization in discourse. The data from 2015 until 2021 show an increase in political polarization for the elite and for the civil society, with similar behaviour between the two groups. A semantic validation is done, and research future steps are given.
